# Subway Hardhat

An updated version of https://github.com/libevm/subway ported to TypeScript and Hardhat. 

Please don't ask me questions about the bot. I'm a n00b. The original dev did all the magic.

I just learned about MEV as part of my crypto journey. This is for learning purposes.

## Please read the three pillars of truth regarding free trading bots:

- No one will give away a bot that makes money for free.
- Most free bots around are honeypots and will steal your Ether.
- As soon as everybody has the same bot, it will lose its edge.

**reread them as many times as necessary**
